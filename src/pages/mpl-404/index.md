description: Provides a high-level overview of the framework and on-chain protocol for hybrid assets.
---

MPL-404 is a framework and on-chain protocol for hybrid assets. Hybrid DeFi brings the liquidity of fungible tokens to non-fungible assets, allowing collectors to swap between fungible and non-fungible versions of the same asset. It will also allow swapping traits of the Assets.

MPL-404 will be based on the "SPL-404" Program by Mutantlabs which has been contributed to the Metaplex Program Library. It is actively being built right now.
